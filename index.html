      <p>Hello! My name is Amuzu Stephen Kafui, and I am from Kumasi, Ghana.</p>
      <p>I enjoy programming and learning web development. My interest in programming sparked when I recognized how technologically advanced the world was becoming.</p>
      <p>I aim to create web applications and websites for both casual and industrial purposes, hoping to collaborate with institutions in Ghana and internationally while building a sustainable career.</p>
      <p>In my free time, I enjoy watching YouTube videos on coding and programming, geopolitics (especially American politics), sports, parody content, educational podcasts, comedy podcasts, and satire comedy.</p>
      <p>Though I may not feel unique, I am motivated to explore whether I can one day achieve something extraordinary in my lifetime.</p>
